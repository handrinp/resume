        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Menards Work</h2>
        <p>Some of my work at Menards can be seen in any Menards store, on the Design-It and Desktop kiosks. You can also use
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.menards.com/main/design-it-center/c-13539.htm">some of the programs online at their website</a>.</p>
        <h2>Task City</h2>
        <p>Now defunct, taskcity.xyz was a website I created some time in 2016 to help me keep track of homework and chores.
          Eventually, I overhauled and upgraded the site to accomodate multiple users, and I maintained the site for around
          10 people. It had a simple design and functionality, but it was a good exercise in web development and software
          engineering. I wrote the site originally in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with an online JSON database, but the upgraded
          version used JSP pages with a MySQL database and Java servlet backend, all running on a virtual private Linux server
          I rented online.
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/handrinp/taskcity">The code is still open source and available on my GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h2>Differentiate Me</h2>
        <p>This started as my attempt to write a calculator program, and it turned into something I'm actually proud of. It's
          a math expression library with a graphing utility and some support for calculus. It doesn't have much practical
          value, but it was and still is a fun exercise in math and programming.
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/handrinp/DifferentiateMe">This project is also open source and available on Github</a>.</p>
        <h2>Game Development</h2>
        <p>During college, I took a 2D game development class focused on Unity games. All of the games I made during the semester
          are availabe
          <a target="_blank" href="https://handrinp.itch.io/">online to play for free</a>.</p>
        <h2>Collatz Cryptographic Cipher</h2>
        <p>My friend John and I developed a new cryptographic stream cipher technique based on a centuries-old, famous, unsolved
          math problem called the Collatz conjecture. Our cipher exploits the seemingly random nature of the Collatz function
          into a cryptographically secure hash function implemented in Java and C.
